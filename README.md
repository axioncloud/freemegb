# Project Inspiration
I have always interested in how emulators work, so I started to have this idea of creating my own emulator variant of the original GameBoy. This simulator is designed to be both educational and eventually complete. Please give me time as this is a personal project that may be dormant from time to time, depending on how life is at home. Feel free to give suggestions and tips at admin@ioncloud64.com.

I look forward to completing FreeMe!GB and discovering Node.js's ability to perform.
