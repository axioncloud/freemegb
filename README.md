# FreeMe!GB
A GameBoy simulator written for Node.js with an Electron front-end. This program is designed to simulate the real hardware that was equipped in the system itself.

## Features
#### Note: not all features may be implemented yet
* Usable debugging utility to track register values as well as CPU instructions
* Interpreted instructions from the loaded ROM
* Self-updating
* Controller Support (Not yet planned)
* Video effects (Not yet planned)


# Project Inspiration
As I have always been fond of programming and dealing with computers, I started to have this idea of creating my own emulator variant of the original GameBoy. This simulator is designed to be both educational and complete. Please give me time as this is a personal project that may increase or decrease depending on my life at home. Feel free to give suggestions and tips.

I look forward to completing FreeMe!GB and discovering Node.js's ability to perform.
